    <title>CSS Mini Project</title>
    <!--? Internal CSS :-- We can write our css in HTML also with the help of style tag here we don't have to write css indiviual elements we can just target that html element with it's name. -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--! Three ways to add CSS with HTML File -->
    <!--? 1. Inline CSS  -->
    <!--* We know that every elements have some global attribute in which there was style attribute also whenever when we give styling through style attribute to HTML element was called Inline CSS or Element Style  -->
    <!-- <h1 style="color: orange">Hello World!</h1> -->
    <!--* Above we are using style attribute and it's property color and value was orange. -->
    <!-- ! The "Color property" was help to give color to our Text in CSS -->
    <!-- <p style="color: red">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Animi adipisci,
      provident esse incidunt ut quasi.
    </p> -->

    <!-- <p style="color: brown">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Nobis ipsa
      maiores earum blanditiis neque velit, sit sequi reprehenderit id aperiam
      consequatur cumque hic omnis, numquam assumenda ea officiis quo iusto illo
      nesciunt facilis? Id fugiat ut, illum minus obcaecati eaque repellendus
      voluptatum suscipit, nobis perferendis sapiente expedita dolorem a
      voluptates?
    </p> -->

    <!--** These all above are example of color property of CSS -->

    <!--? Now there was problem in Inline Styling that was if we want to give same color to minimum 10 elements than we have to give manually one by one. So The work become tideous and in coding there was principal "DRY" which means Don't repeat yourself. -->
    <!--! For that we are using Internal styling or Internal CSS.  For internal css we are using Style tag in head tag. -->
