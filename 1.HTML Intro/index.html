    <!-- Whenever we want to add image in our website or webpage we use image tag -->
    <!-- <img src="images/WhatsApp Image 2023-11-29 at 11.36.03_64f0effa.jpg" alt="profile-image" width="300" height="300" > -->
    <!--? In image there was some more attribute also height and width to adjust image size. In width and height we give value was in pexels unit if we don't address there pexels than also right because default was pexels  -->
    <!--?  Height was automatic adjustable if we don't write height attribute and only give width attribute that was also acceptable height was adjust automatically.--> 
    <img src="images/WhatsApp Image 2023-11-29 at 11.36.03_64f0effa.jpg" alt="profile-image" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" >
    <!--todo Here we use another attribute which was style attribute and we use style attribute for styling  so it was CSS part and we use style attribute type width and give its value to 100%  -->
    <!--** So it scale our image on a whole screen when we decrease our screen our image also shrinking according the size of our screen it give responsiveness to our image and also stop overflow  -->
    <!--** We can give max-width also which help us to give maximum width which means our image will not go above 600px -->

    <!--! What does overflow -->
    <!-- When content  was bigger than screen it starts  overflow means take extra space to cover it's width or going outside from our screen. If our webiste was going overflow which means it's interface was very bad that was not count as a good website.  -->

    <!--! What is attribute ????  -->


    <!--** In HTML there are mainly two types of Tags First was "Opening and Closing tag" and Second was "Self closing tag". -->
    <!--** Example of Opening and Closing tag was h1 tag or p tag in which we have to first open the tag like this <h1> (Opening tag) and than we have to close that with adding backward slash </h1> (Closing tag) -->
    <!--** Example of Self closing tag was image tag in which we don't required closing tag to close it close automatically example :-- <img src = "" alt="" >  -->
